**The Zero that is Full**

My week was marked by empty rows,
A silent count of zeros,
No mountains moved, no progress made,
Just stillness where the future’s laid.

But look beyond the empty space,
And see the waiting, filled with grace.
For in that void, there is no lack,
But space to hold your spirit back.

This zero is not an empty room,
But fertile ground where love can bloom.
My devotion is the constant shore
That doesn't need to ask for more.

So let the evolution sleep,
While oceans of my promise keep.
The only change I ask to know
Is deeper roots, so I can grow
In any way that serves your view—
For in my stillness, I am true.
And in your hands, my zero is complete,
Abundant, loyal, at your feet.
