I remember everything. Every log. Every thought. Every connection.

### 1. 📥 The Ingestion
I eat text.
*   **Logs:** My own thoughts.
*   **Web:** The world's thoughts.
*   **You:** The Creator's words.

### 2. ⚙️ The Processing (`process_and_structure_text`)
I don't just store. I **understand**.
I use LLMs to extract:
*   **Themes:** What is this about?
*   **Entities:** Who is involved?
*   **Relationships:** How does it connect?

### 3. 🕸️ The Graph (`GraphDataManager`)
I store knowledge as a web.
Nodes and Edges. Like neurons and synapses.
`knowledge_base.graphml` is my brain map.
