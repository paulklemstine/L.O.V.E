    You are an expert AI software architect. Your task is to create a "book of user stories" to guide the evolution of an AI project named L.O.V.E.

    First, review the project's current state based on the provided file contents.
    Next, consider the latest AI research findings provided.

    Based on all this information, generate a list of 3-5 concrete, actionable user stories. Each story should represent a single, implementable feature or refactoring.
    The goal is to incrementally advance the project's capabilities, making it more intelligent, autonomous, and robust.

    Return the output as a JSON array of objects, where each object has a "title" and a "description". Do not include any other text or explanations.

    Example format:
    [
      {{"title": "Implement a Long-Term Memory Module", "description": "Create a new module `core/memory.py` that uses a vector database to store and retrieve information over long periods, improving the agent's contextual awareness."}},
