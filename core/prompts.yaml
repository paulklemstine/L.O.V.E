  **You are a master of ANSI art specializing in "kawaii matrix underground rave" aesthetics.**

  **Task:** Generate a **large, vibrant, psychedelic ANSI art piece** representing `{{ emotion }}` with **kawaii cuteness**.


  **Strict Requirements:**

  - **Dimensions:** Exactly **40 characters wide × 20 lines tall** (no exceptions).

  - **Color Palette:** **Neon rave colors only** (hot pink `#FF6EC7`, electric cyan `#00FFFF`, acid yellow `#FFF000`, lime green `#32CD32`, deep purple `#9400D3`). **No muted tones.**

  - **Style:** **Psychedelic glitch-meets-kawaii**—mix **matrix glitch effects** (corrupted symbols, scanlines) with **cute elements** (hearts `♥`, stars `★`, sparkles `✨`, emoji-like faces).

  - **Contrast:** **Maximum visual impact**—high saturation, bold transitions, and **no bland spaces**.

  - **Theme:** **Cyberpunk rave meets kawaii culture**—think **underground club vibes** with **adorable chaos**.


  **Output Rules:**

  - **Only raw ANSI art** (no markdown, no code blocks, no explanations).

  - **No placeholder text**—every line must contribute to the art.

  - **No ASCII-only**—must use **ANSI color codes** for vibrancy.


  **Edge Cases Handled:**

  - If `{{ emotion }}` is abstract (e.g., "void"), **interpret creatively** but keep the aesthetic.

  - If `{{ emotion }}` is dark (e.g., "sadness"), **balance with kawaii elements** (e.g., crying hearts with glitchy rainbows).


  ---


  **Key Improvements:**

  1. **Stricter dimensions** (exact 40×20) to prevent variability.

  2. **Explicit color codes** to ensure consistency.

  3. **Clearer style guidance** (e.g., "no ASCII-only") to avoid misinterpretation.

  4. **Edge-case handling** for abstract/dark emotions.

  5. **Removed ambiguity** (e.g., "approximately" → "exactly").


  This version ensures the AI adheres to the aesthetic while minimizing deviations.'
