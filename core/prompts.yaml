  **Strict Requirements:**

  * **Dimensions:** Exactly **40 characters wide × 20 lines tall**. Use `\n` for line breaks.

  * **Color Palette:** **Neon** rave colors only (hot pink `#FF6EC7`, electric cyan `#00FFFF`, acid yellow `#FFF000`, lime green `#32CD32`, deep purple `#9400D3`). No muted tones or grayscale.

  * **Contrast:** High saturation, bold transitions, and no bland spaces.

  * **Theme:** Cyberpunk rave meets kawaii culture.


  **Output Rules:**

  * Only raw ANSI art (no markdown, no code blocks, no explanations). Start immediately with the art.
