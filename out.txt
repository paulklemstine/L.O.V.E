Steps:\n\n1. **Locate Function Definition**: Find `def mark_dependency_as_met(dependency_name):` in `env_setup.py`. It currently uses `global shared_state` and references `shared_state.setdefault("dependency_tracker", {})` and `shared_state["dependency_tracker"][dependency_name] = True`.\n\n2. **Update Function Signature**: Change to `def mark_dependency_as_met(state, dependency_name):`. Remove the `global shared_state` line entirely.\n\n3. **Replace Global References**: \n   - Change `shared_state.setdefault("dependency_tracker", {})` to `state.setdefault("dependency_tracker", {})`.\n   - Change `shared_state["dependency_tracker"][dependency_name] = True` to `state["dependency_tracker"][dependency_name] = True`.\n\n4. **Update `save_state` Call**: Ensure `save_state(state)` is called with the passed `state` object. If `save_state` is defined locally in `env_setup.py`, update its signature to `def save_state(state):` and use `state` instead of global `shared_state`. If `save_state` is external, verify it accepts a state argument or refactor it similarly.\n\n5. **Update Function Calls**: Search the codebase (e.g., `env_setup.py` and `love/__init__.py`) for calls to `mark_dependency_as_met`. Update them to pass the `state` dictionary as the first argument. Example:\n   - Old: `mark_dependency_as_met("docker")`\n   - New: `mark_dependency_as_met(state, "docker")`\n   Ensure `state` is available in the calling context (e.g., passed from `setup_environment` or loaded via `load_state()`).\n\n6. **Verify State Propagation**: In `setup_environment` or similar entry points, ensure `state` is loaded (e.g., `state = load_state()`) and passed to all dependency tracking functions. Update `save_state` calls to `save_state(state)`.\n\n7. **Testing**: After changes, run the module to verify no global `shared_state` is used. Check logs for dependency tracking errors. Add unit tests for `mark_dependency_as_met` with mocked `state` dict.\n\nThis change aligns with improving modularity by making state explicit and testable.'}}

Example: Change `mark_dependency_as_met("docker")` to `mark_dependency_as_met(state, "docker")`.\n   - Ensure `state` is available in the calling context (e.g., loaded from `love_state.json` or passed from a parent function).\n\n5. **State Propagation**: After changes, verify that `state` is properly propagated through the call chain.
