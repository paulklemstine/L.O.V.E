This involves several key changes:\n\n1. **Code Structure Optimization**: Simplify complex conditional structures and remove unnecessary redundancy.\n2. **Type Hints**: Introduce Python's type hints to en...\n\nSPECIFIC TASK:\nIdentify and remove any duplicate or superfluous checks within `check_conditions`. Ensure that only necessary conditions remain.",
