Seed codebase,**\n**I want to refactor the core `love.py` file,**\n**So that its Cyclomatic Complexity (currently 589) is drastically reduced, its readability and maintainability are significantly improved through clear modularization and consistent type hinting, and its startup sequence is robust, predictable, and resilient.**\n\n### Acceptance Criteria:\n\nThis refactor...\n\nSPECIFIC TASK:\nConduct a thorough review of `love.py`, `config.py`, `state_manager.py`, `dependency_manager.py`, and `startup.py` to ensure comprehensive and accurate type hinting. Verify that all function/method parameters, return types, class attributes in new modules, and key local variables have explicit and correct type hints, aligning with the examples provided (e.g., `ui_panel_queue: queue.Queue[Any]`, `VRAM_MODEL_MAP: Dict[int, Dict[str, str]]`).",
